## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on page layout and page responsiveness.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site

## My process

Create comments section
Create replies section
Create textarea to add comment
Create modal container to delete comment or reply
Give styles in CSS
Add hover effects in CSS
Add media queris

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Queries
- React

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using React, the main challenge that I overcame was to create React punctionality to add comment and reply. After research and practicing different ways for resolving this step, I wrote the React code which worked eventually.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic,interactive and responsive projects.
